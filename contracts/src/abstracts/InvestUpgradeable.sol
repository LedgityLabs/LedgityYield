/**
 * @title InvestUpgradeable
 * @author Lila Rest (https://lila.rest)
 * @custom:security-contact security@ledgity.com
 *
 * @notice Derived contracts are provided with utilities to manage an invested token,
 * users' investment periods, rewards calculations, virtual balances, and auto-compounding.
 *
 * @dev Intuition:
 * This contract primarily exists for code splitting and reusability. It unburdens the
 * LToken contract code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
 *
 * This contract is generic because it may be used in the LDYStaking contract in the future.
 *
 * @dev Definitions:
 * - Investment: The act of depositing or investing tokens into the contract.
 * - Investment period: Time between the last invested amount change and the present.
 * - Virtual balance: Temporary storage for account rewards, used when those can't be
 *                    distributed between investment periods.
 * - Rewards redirection: Mechanism allowing an account to redirect its rewards to another.
 *
 * @dev Derived contract must:
 *  - Set invested token during initialization
 *  - Implement _investmentOf() function
 *  - (optionally) Implement _distributeRewards() function
 *
 * @dev For further details, see "InvestmentUpgradeable" section of whitepaper.
