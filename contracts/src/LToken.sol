/**
 * @title LToken
 * @author Lila Rest (https://lila.rest)
 * @custom:security-contact security@ledgity.com
 *
 * @notice Main contract of the Ledgity Yield protocol. It powers every L-Token (i.e.,
 * investment pools backed by RWA). An L-Token is an ERC20 wrapper around a stablecoin.
 * As soon as a wallet holds some L-Tokens, it starts receiving rewards in
 * the form of additional L-Tokens, which are auto-compounded over time.
 *
 * @dev Definitions:
 * - Deposit: Swap of underlying tokens for L-Tokens (1:1 ratio).
 * - Withdrawal: Swap of L-Tokens for underlying tokens (1:1 ratio, minus applicable fees).
 *   - Instant: Processed immediately.
 *   - Request: Queued for later processing.
 *   - Big Request: A requested withdrawal exceeding half of the retention rate.
 * - (Withdrawal) queue: A list of all requested withdrawals sorted by priority.
 * - Request ID: The index of a withdrawal request in the queue array.
 * - Retention rate: Maximum fraction of underlying tokens TVL the contract can retain.
 * - Fees Rate: Percentage of fees applied to successful withdrawals.
 * - Usable underlyings: Amount of underlying tokens that have been deposited through
 *                       expected ways and are so considered safe to use by the contract.
 * - Transfers listeners: External contracts listening on L-Tokens transfers.
 * - Fund wallet: Wallet managed by the Ledgity's financial team.
 * - Withdrawer wallet: Managed by an off-chain server to automate withdrawal request
 *                      processing.
 *
 * Note that words between parenthesis are sometimes omitted for brevity.
 *
 * @dev Deployment notice:
 * This contract can safely receive funds immediately after initialization. (i.e., there
 * is no way for funds to be sent to non-owned addresses). It is, however, recommended to
 * replace ASAP owner and fund wallets with multi-sig wallets.
 *
 * @dev For further details, see "LToken" section of whitepaper.
 * @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow external-library-linking
